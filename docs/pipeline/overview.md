# coppaFISH pipeline

Here we outline in detail, how each part of the pipeline works including what each parameter in
the configuration file is used for. We also point to useful [plots](../code/plot/viewer.md) that can be run
for debugging purposes or to help understand what is going on.

If at any stage, a section of the pipeline, needs re-running, then the relevant *NotebookPage* must first be 
[removed](../notebook.md#deleting-a-notebookpage) 
from the *Notebook* before the configuration file parameters for that section can be altered.
