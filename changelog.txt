22/09/2023 Update:
 * Added background subtraction with 3D registration with DAPI.
 * Cross-tile brightness difference correction support, probably caused by microscope auto gain control.
 * Updated bleed matrix to allow inter-tile variation.
 * Updated the bleed matrix calculation.
 * Added weighted dot product method with backwards compatibility.
 * Error handling unconnected tiles.
 * Changed spot_no array from uint16 to uint32 for great spot number support.
 * Registration pipeline now uses DAPI images when necessary.
 * Registration pipeline now computes camera transforms from fluorescent beads.
 * Shrunk large .png image sizes to reduce repository download size.
 * Added new config variable [file_names][initial_bleed_matrix] to give a path to a `.npy` initial bleed matrix. \
   If left empty, will use the default initial bleed matrix found in the code.
 * Presequence .npy raw files support.
 * Fixed anchor auto threshold being set to zero due to regularisation.
 * OMP's z-chunking now scales with the PC's available memory. We think that more memory means slightly faster OMP.
