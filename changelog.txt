2023/10/09 Alpha Update (v0.1.7):
 * Added background subtraction with 3D registration using DAPI images.
 * Cross-tile brightness difference correction support, probably caused by microscope auto gain control.
 * Updated bleed matrix to allow inter-tile variation.
 * Updated the bleed matrix calculation.
 * Added weighted dot product method with backwards compatibility.
 * Error handling unconnected tiles.
 * Changed spot_no array from uint16 to uint32 for greater spot number support.
 * Registration pipeline now uses DAPI images when necessary.
 * Registration pipeline now computes camera transforms from fluorescent beads, if they exist.
 * Added new config variable [file_names][initial_bleed_matrix] to give a path to a `.npy` initial bleed matrix. \
   If left empty, will use the default initial bleed matrix in the source code.
 * Presequence .npy raw files support.
 * Fixed anchor auto threshold being set to zero due to regularisation.
 * OMP's z-chunking now scales with the PC's available memory. We think that more memory means slightly faster OMP.
 * Various bug, warning and deprecation fixes.
 * Utils, call spots and register unit tests.
 * RoboMinnie integration testing for single tile dataset.
